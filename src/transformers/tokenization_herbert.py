    Construct a BPE tokenizer for HerBERT.

    Peculiarities:

    - uses BERT's pre-tokenizer: BaseTokenizer splits tokens on spaces, and also on punctuation.
      Each occurence of a punctuation character will be treated separately.

    - Such pretokenized input is BPE subtokenized

    This tokenizer inherits from :class:`~transformers.XLMTokenizer` which contains most of the methods. Users
    should refer to the superclass for more information regarding methods.
